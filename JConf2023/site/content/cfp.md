Call for Papers JConf Guatemala 2023
====================================

**We are looking for you as speaker in 2023!**

**JConf Guatemala is the biggest Java conference in Central America**, since 2011 we've constructed an exchange hub for software developers, architects, and enthusiasts around Java technologies in Guatemala.

JConf will be hosted at Guatemala City on **august 5**, being a conference by and for the developer community.

Speak at JConf 2023!
====================
The Guatemala Java Users group -[GuateJUG](http://www.guate-jug.net)- is pleased to invite all the people interested in sharing knowledge with **talks and workshops for beginners and senior developers**.

Do you have something interesting to share with the community? Innovations made with Java?, Java success stories?. **We and the JConf Attendees wanna know about you**.  

We've divided the conference in different tracks, being:  

Java Platform
-------------

Any topic related with the JVM as development platform including, Java Core, certifications, JVM internals, Java language, OpenJDK.

Alternative languages
---------------------

Considering the Java Virtual Machine as a polyglot execution environment, this space is specially designed for presentations related with GraalVM, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, JavaScript and beyond.

Server side development
-----------------------

Our most popular track. Main track focus is presentations about Java as enterprise development platform. Java EE, Spring, Akka, Spark, Kafka, MicroProfile, RxJava, etc. Every Java framework, library and standard is welcome.

Client side development
-----------------------

Interested in client side development?, all presentations related with JavaFX, HTML5+CSS+JS, Krazo, Vaadin, JSF, UI/UX, go here.

Small and not so small Java
---------------------------

SmartCards, Java Embedded, iOT, Java Me, Java TV, Android, Arduino, Rasberry Pi and related activities. Java was born here.

Big (Data with) Java
----------------------------------

A new track for this year. We recognize the importance of the JVM in the Data Engineering space, hence this year we will be receiving proposals for topics like Kafka, Hadoop, Spark, Beam, Storm. It doesn't matter if you execute your queries with Scala, Java, Pig, Python, R, in the end all roads converge to the JVM.

Tools, architecture and strategies
----------------------------------

There is no wizard without a magic wand. This section includes all technologies and strategies to improve Java code quality. IDEs, CI/CD, DevOps, Docker, Kubernets, Blockchain, Hyperledger, and any other buzzword.

Startups with Java
------------------

This space will present success stories, academic papers, market tendencies and startups implementing Java as its main platform.

Proposals reception
===================

It is important to consider:

* By historical reasons, JConf is a free for all, 110% community event. Hence we reserve the right to accept presentation with the only objective to promote a commercial product. We also have sponsorship opportunities that could fit better for this.

* The speaker declares that presentation will be created in a "shareable" format with a proper license (we suggest [CC-BY-SA 3.0 GT](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/gt/)).

* There is no limit for proposals per speaker.

Thank you again for contributing with the Java World!
