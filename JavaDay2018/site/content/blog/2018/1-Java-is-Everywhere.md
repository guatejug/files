## Abstract

From [jaxenter](https://jaxenter.com/duke-the-java-mascot-explained-118397.html).

Well, believe it or not, **Duke was initially designed to represent a “software agent” that performed tasks for the user.** According to Java.net, “Duke was the interactive host that enabled a new type of user interface that went beyond the buttons, mice, and pop-up menus of the desktop computing world”.

Wait… that sounds rather familiar.

Sun Microsystems’ Green Project team created its first working demo that featured Duke, the star of their touch-screen user interface. The interactive handheld home entertainment controller was called the Star7.

As for artist credit, Joe Palrang is the man you can thank for spawning the blob-like Duke, who went on to work for DreamWorks on animated films like Shrek, Antz and Flushed Away. During his time at Sun, Palrang was the Art Director for demo animation/applications, as well as for initial Java technology.

Palrang was also responsible for this earlier concept drawing of Duke, which represented the Green Project team more specifically.

When the good ol’ early cup logo for Java was commissioned, Duke became the official mascot for the language. “Duke was instantly embraced”, recalls Java.net, and the mascot peaked in terms of what he could become. And by peaked, we mean there was a freaking comic made about him! ‘The Amazing Adventures of Duke‘ was released in 1996, where he became “the Net’s Smoothest Code Man”. Yes, we can confirm Duke is a man.

The comic features an impressive storyline with Java patriarch James Gosling himself making an appearance. Debuting with 16 pages in standard issue colour, only one issue was ever catalogued. Neal Adams is credited as the artist, and to comic book fans, that’s quite the coup. He’s known for helping create the definitive modern imagery of DC Comics characters Superman, Batman, and Green Arrow, as well as penciling several issues of X-Men for Marvel Comics.
