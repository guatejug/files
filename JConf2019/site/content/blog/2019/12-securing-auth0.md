## Description

Join me on this talk where I will showcase how a combination between Auth0 (externalized security solution) and Eclipse MicroProfile can help developers simplify the security aspects of their applications by doing a live demonstration of securing enterprise Java Microservices under 40 minutes!

Implementing the correct security patterns is a common challenge that most application developers and consultants can get wrong in even the most common of scenarios. Reinventing the wheel is a common pattern that developers follow for implementing their security solutions inside their applications (authentication, password validation, identity management, correct storage of user data, etc.). Auth0 is a service that focuses on taking the worry of implementing these aspects in the right way, allowing developers to focus on other business aspects of their applications. This talk will focus on the benefits of using such a service with a Java EE/Jakarta EE application and will showcase a live demonstration of a small application that uses the Eclipse MicroProfile APIs in order to correctly integrate this application with the Auth0 service.

The talk will make use of Payara Micro to demonstrate how easy is to provide this solution in a production scenario as well.
